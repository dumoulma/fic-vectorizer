TITLE
Research & development for Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless
location based on synthetic array.
REQUIREMENT
The Department of National Defence has a requirement to conduct
research and development of innovative self geo-location
techniques for LTE based on synthetic array processing, by
analyzing existing methodologies and developing innovative
synthetic array techniques for self geo-location of LTE devices.
Theoretical analysis, mathematical models, simulations, and
laboratory experimentation must be used to develop, assess, and
validate the new techniques. The reported work and findings
must be of sufficient detail and complexity to provide
proof-of-concept data that validates the developed techniques,
models, and theoretical analysis.
Phase 1: An analysis of the current LTE standard and its
physical layer in the context of self geo-location will be
conducted. This understanding is then applied to an assessment
f the access nodes and handsets in an effort to develop a
system level description and a model for the wireless signaling
f LTE devices.
Phase 2: Combining methods and location estimation algorithms
are developed based on LTE signaling and synthetic array
processing. These new algorithms are verified using simulations
and experimentation. The performance of the algorithms is then
analyzed taking into account advanced antenna configurations.
Optional Phase 3 - Go/ No Go: The findings of Phases 1 and 2 may
be extended to enhance the self geo-location performance in
terms of received signal-to-noise-ratio and geo-location
accuracy using multi-antenna techniques. New developments in
the LTE standard taking place during the first two phases may be
also incorporated in Phase 3.
The period of the Contract is from date of Contract to March 31,
2013 inclusive.
The requirement is subject to the provisions of the Agreement on
Internal Trade (AIT).
The requirement is limited to Canadian goods and/or services.
MAXIMUM FUNDING:
The maximum funding available for the contract resulting from
the bid solicitation is $150,000.00 (Goods and Services Tax or
the Harmonized Sales Tax extra, as appropriate). Bids valued in
excess of this amount will be considered non-responsive. This
disclosure does not commit Canada to pay the maximum funding
available.
MANDATORY TECHNICAL CRITERIA:
At bid closing time, the Bidder must comply with the following
mandatory technical criteria and provide the necessary
documentation to support compliance. Any bid which fails to meet
the following mandatory technical criteria will be declared
non-responsive. Each criterion should be addressed separately.
M1. The Bidder must submit the name and curriculum vitae
(CV) for the Project Leader,
which should be submitted in accordance with the Project Leader
Résumé Summary Sheet as found in Appendix 1 of
Attachment 2, to clearly demonstrate that it meets all of the
requirements of this solicitation.
M2. The Project Leader must have completed a Master's degree
from a recognized
Canadian* university, or the equivalent, if obtained outside of
Canada, in either
Engineering or Physics.
*Where the Master's degree was completed and
btained outside of Canada, Canada reserves the
right to request a Canadian equivalency document issued by a
recognized academic credentials
assessment organization showing the academic level obtained.
