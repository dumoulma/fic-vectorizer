Opportunity Description:
Advance Contract Award Notice: 
 
The University of Alberta on behalf of the Department of Medicine - Cardiology, is issuing notice of an Advance Contract Award for a Philips iE33 Echocardiography System 
 
Nature of the Requirement: 3D Transesophageal Ultrasound 
 
Substitutes: None 
 
Vendor Name and Address: 
Philips Electronics Ltd. 
281 Hillmount Road 
Markham, Ontario

Requirements: 
 
3D real-time echocardiography is a mandatory requirement. The three dimensional real-time echocardiography is only possible with the Philips iE33 System. The University of Alberta will perform teaching courses on 3D echocardiography. 
 
Compatibility with existing processes is essential to the University. The iE33 is the most advanced echocardiography equipment for contrast echocardiography. Ongoing research projects on contrast stress echocardiography and cardio toxicity are performed on an existing iE33. This machine is required for additional patients. Using a different echocardiography scanner would cause inhomogeneous methods and reduced sensitivity for detecting myocardial contrast.
